This POC is FastAPI which is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *

Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *

Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.

Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.

Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.

Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.

Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications.
